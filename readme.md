## ApiClient

A small app that I started as an effort to learn the basics of php language and Laravel framework.

It fetches and displays information from a fake online JSON API (https://github.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder). The app can get all resources or individual resource by ID and display them in a view.

The app is currently deployed at https://warm-fortress-16565.herokuapp.com/
